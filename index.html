        <h2>What is Version Control?</h2><br>
        <p>
            Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.<br>
            Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.<br> 
            As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.<br>
            They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

        <h2>What is Git?</h2><br>
        <p>
            By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. <br>
            Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System).<br>
            In Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.<br>
            In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind.

            <p><span>git init</span></p>
            <p class="detail">
                Initialises a git repository (repo) for a new or existing
                project. Run command in the root of your project directory.

            <h4>‚ú¶COPY A GIT REPOSITORY</h4><br>
            <p><span>git clone ("https://name-of-the-repository-link")</span></p>
            <p class="detail">
                Makes an identical copy of the latest version of a
                project in a repo (e.g. Github) and saves it to your computer.
            </p><br>

        <div>
            <h4>‚ú¶CHECK STATUS OF YOUR BRANCH</h4><br>
            <p><span>git status</span></p>
            <p class="detail">
                gives all the necessary information about the current
                branch (working directory), i.e, changes made since last commit.
            </p><br>

        <div>
            <h4>‚ú¶ADD CHANGES TO DIRECTORY</h4><br>
            <p><span>git add.</span></p>
            <p class="detail">
                When you create, modify or delete a file, changes
                happen in your local and won't be included in the next commit, so
                you need to use git add to include changes of any file(s) into your
                next commit
            </p><br>

        <div>
            <h4>‚ú¶COMMIT YOUR CHANGES</h4><br>
            <p><span>git commit -m "your commit message"</span></p>
            <p class="detail">
                There will be a point in development where you want
                to save your changes. You also need to write a short message to
                explain what you've changed or developed in your code.
            </p><br>
        </div>

            <h4>‚ú¶UPLOAD YOUR COMMITS TO GIT</h4><br>
            <p><span>git push (remote) (branch-name)</span></p>
            <p class="detail">
                After committing your changes you need to send
                your changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits
                to the remote repository.
            </p><br>

        <div>

            <p><span>git pull (remote)</span></p>
            <p class="detail">
                git pull is used to get updates from the remote repo.
                When we use git pull, it gets updates from remote repos (git fetch)
                and applies the latest changes in your local (git merge).

            </p><br>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>‚ú¶MERGE YOUR BRANCH INTO PARENT BRANCH</h4><br>
            <p><span>git merge (branch-name)</span></p>
            <p class="detail">
                When you've completed development in your branch,
                the final step is merging the branch with the parent branch (dev or
                master). Git merge integrates your feature branch with all of its
                commits back to the dev (or master) branch.
